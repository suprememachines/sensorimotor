	/**
	 * \brief Basic ADXL345 digital accelerometer sensor driver
	 *
	 * The ADXL345 is a 3-axis accelerometer with high resolution (13-bit)
	 * measurement at up to +-16 g. Digital output data is formatted as 16-bit
	 * two's complement and is accessible through I2C digital interface.
	 *
	 * Its high resolution (4 mg/LSB) enables measurement of inclination
	 * changes less than 1.0 degree.
	 * Several special sensing functions are provided. Activity and inactivity
	 * sensing detect the presence or lack of motion and if the acceleration on
	 * any axis exceeds a user-set level. Tap sensing detects single and double
	 * taps. Free-fall sensing detects if the device is falling. These functions
	 * can be mapped to one of two interrupt output pins. An integrated 32-level
	 * first in, first out (FIFO) buffer can be used to store data to minimize
	 * host processor intervention.
	 * Low power modes enable intelligent motion-based power management with
	 * threshold sensing and active acceleration measurement at extremely low
	 * power dissipation.
	 *
	 * For further information on the special sensing functions, consult the
	 * <a href="http://www.analog.com/static/imported-files/data_sheets/ADXL345.pdf">
	 * datasheet</a>.
